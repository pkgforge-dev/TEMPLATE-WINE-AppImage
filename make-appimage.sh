# Pick ONE of the two approaches below (or use RUNTIME INSTALL in the hook
# instead — see README). Both examples use real, working URLs so you can
# see the pattern end-to-end; replace with your own app's download link.

# --- Example A: plain zip / portable build (build-time extraction) --------
# e.g. Notepad++'s portable zip release:
#
# mkdir -p "AppDir/share/$APPNAME"
# wget -q "https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/releases/download/v8.7.1/npp.8.7.1.portable.x64.zip" \
#     -O app.zip
# unzip -q app.zip -d "AppDir/share/$APPNAME"

# --- Example B: installer .exe, extracted at build time --------------------
# Most NSIS/Inno installers can be unpacked with 7z instead of run through
# Wine, which keeps the AppImage self-contained and avoids running the
# installer's UI at all. e.g. foobar2000's installer:
#
# mkdir -p "AppDir/share/$APPNAME"
# wget -q "https://www.foobar2000.org/files/foobar2000-${VERSION}.exe" \
#     -O installer.exe
# 7z x -aos installer.exe -o"AppDir/share/$APPNAME" >/dev/null 2>&1
# rm -f installer.exe
# # Installer exe names often don't match the real Windows binary name —
# # rename here so it matches MAIN_EXE:
# # mv "AppDir/share/$APPNAME/some-installed-name.exe" "AppDir/share/$APPNAME/$MAIN_EXE"

# --- Example C: .msi installer, extracted at build time --------------------
# msiexec-based installers can be extracted directly with 7z too:
#
# mkdir -p "AppDir/share/$APPNAME"
# wget -q "https://example.com/download/${APPNAME}-${VERSION}.msi" -O app.msi
# 7z x -aos app.msi -o"AppDir/share/$APPNAME" >/dev/null 2>&1
# rm -f app.msi

# --- Example D: bundle the installer/zip itself, install on first launch ---
# Instead of extracting at build time, ship the raw installer/zip inside the
# AppImage and let APPNAME.hook's RUNTIME INSTALL flow run it on first
# launch. Keeps the AppImage self-contained (no network needed at runtime)
# while still deferring the actual install — set INSTALL_URL in the hook to
# the bundled path shown below.
#
# Downloaded fresh during CI (no need to store the file in the repo):
#
# mkdir -p "AppDir/share"
# wget -q "https://example.com/download/MyApp-Setup.exe" \
#     -O "AppDir/share/MyApp-Setup.exe"
# # Then in APPNAME.hook: INSTALL_URL="$APPDIR/share/MyApp-Setup.exe"
#
# Committed directly to this repo instead (e.g. no stable download URL, or
# you want to pin an exact binary) — put the file in a top-level payload/
# directory (add it to .gitattributes as `binary` / consider Git LFS if
# it's large), then just copy it in at build time:
#
# mkdir -p "AppDir/share"
# cp "payload/MyApp-Setup.exe" "AppDir/share/MyApp-Setup.exe"
# # Then in APPNAME.hook: INSTALL_URL="$APPDIR/share/MyApp-Setup.exe"
